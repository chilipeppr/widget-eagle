<pre>
chilipeppr.subscribe(
    "/com-chilipeppr-widget-eagle/addGcode", 
    this, 
    this.myOnAddGcode

            Then, your callback would look like this with 4 parameters receiving the variables

            The 1500 in the example above is to attach a priority to where our Gcode will get positioned. 
            The base Gcode ends around line 900. The footer starts at line 2000. So putting our Gcode at 
            the end but before the footer means using 1500 should do fine. You can analyze the existing 
            Gcode by looking at parameter 2 gcodeParts to see if an index has already been used so you 
            don't clobber it. If you want to delete Gcode from gcodeParts you could do that as well and 
            the main widget will reflect the deletion.

You want to use the largest endmill you can, but you are limited by how closely spaced your elements are. It is best to leave this value alone, however you can attempt to expand your endmill at the cost of milling into other elements.</p> -->

If you are going to manually set this value, best practice is to set this value to half of your endmill size. Then check the 3D viewer to see what effect it will have on taking away too much copper. You can use the "actual endmill" feature below to better visualize this offset combined with how much copper the endmill will take off.</p> -->
                                <p class="descriptive-text">Inflate your milling path by half the diameter of your endmill. If you are using a 0.5mm endmill, then enter 0.25mm above. If you are using a V-bit then figure out the diameter based on how deep you'll mill. Copper on FR4 is usually
                                    1 oz = 0.035mm, 2 oz = 0.07mm, 3 oz = 0.105mm thick. If you use ChiliPeppr's Auto-Level, you could safely mill with depths of 1 oz = 0.07mm, 2 oz = 0.1mm (most popular), 3 oz = 0.15mm. That means a V-bit with a 45&deg; angle
                                    at 0.1mm depth will have a diameter of roughly 0.1mm. So, you could use 0.05mm above, however, in practice it would be best to inflate further than that to be safe.</p>

                    <p style="font-size:10px;">This approach assumes you have painted, rolled, glued, or stuck on a solder mask and you want to laser 
                    etch or mill away the solder pads and smd pads. This can work with paint or rolled 
                    on solder mask. Some people use Dynamask, which is a gel film you laminate on with a hot roller. Some
                    people use vinyl and then cut out the pads, then paint. Laser etching the mask can work because copper is highly reflective 
                    and thus lasers won't effect it, while burning away the paint. Milling is possible, but 
                    you need to be massively accurate on your Z depth to not mill away the copper and only mill 
                    the mask ink. Auto-levelling is highly suggested before mask if milling.</p>
